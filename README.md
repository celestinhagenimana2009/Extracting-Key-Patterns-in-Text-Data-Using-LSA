Hey there 👋! This repository contains my work on Extracting Key Patterns in Text Data using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), conducted at AIMS Rwanda.

The project focuses on transforming textual data into numerical representations using TF–IDF, applying SVD for dimensionality reduction, and uncovering latent semantic structures to enable meaningful document comparison and query analysis.

I sincerely thank Prof. Franck Kalala Mutombo for his valuable supervision, guidance, and continuous support throughout this work. His insights greatly contributed to the clarity, rigor, and overall quality of the project.

I am also grateful to AIMS Rwanda for providing a stimulating academic environment that supports applied mathematics and data science research.
